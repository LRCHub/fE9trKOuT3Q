[02:34.00] He couldn't believe how easy it was
[02:39.19]  He put the gun into his face
[02:44.24]  Bang!
[02:47.24] 
[02:48.99]  So much blood for such a tiny little hole
[02:55.23]  Problems do have solutions, you know
[02:59.68]  A lifetime of fucking things up
[03:02.41]  Fixed in one determined flash
[03:17.41] 
[03:28.36]  Everything's blue
[03:31.95]  Everything is blue this world
[03:36.96]  The deepest shade of mushroom blue
[03:41.32]  All fuzzy, this is spilling out of my head
