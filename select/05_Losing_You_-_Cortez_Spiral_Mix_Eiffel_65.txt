I lost the count now of how many letters
I've wrote from here
And I lost the count now of how many days
I've been away from home

And I remember the time that you asked me
What was right or wrong
And I don't care
What I'm missing is you, you

Can't get over losing you
And so I'm tired
I just can't get over losing you
And so I can't get over losing you
