My dreams and my goals, now I can feel my soul
Heart pumping like some gold, you smell the rosemary
In the kitchen, I'm flipping the cakes of hell
Niggas been hating on me, my cape has proved to prevail
Emotions show on my face, just know I'm serious
I'm insecure about my body, bitches know I'm furious
Lying to the bone of my teeth
I'm wishing memories that I collected reach the reef
I'm thinking that my soul is cold, I feel the hole in my heart
I'm thinking the ignition is broken, the pedal won't push
Curiosity fills my brain, I'm filled with pain
Reminiscing on memories of my stained bowl
Of course it had spaghetti in the bowl, we used that shit for weeks
I see my bro godard, he got his streams up
I'm waiting for my time, like I'm waiting for my prime
Or will it ever come, I'm sick and tired of the waiting game
I used to write my lyrics down on my paper plate
Thinking bout the daydreams of the everglades
And if I ever raise my hand too blatantly, understand
So I feel the sun on my fucking hand
To ever succumb to the feeling of loneliness
Rejoicing on the times I had everything felt
Sometimes, every time I blink I see a day go by
And I don't even smoke nor do I get high
I'm fighting for my feelings to feel em
Numb to the brim, they told me that you can't shed a tear
I'm feeling the fear of being a weakling or being seen as one
Or would that make me tough if maybe I had a gun
I'm running from the feeling of fear, feeling of care
From others that I can't even bear
I'm feeling the tears, I want em but I can't even hear
But I can't even hear
My dreams and my goals, now I can feel my soul
Heart pumping like some gold, you smell the rosemary
In the kitchen, I'm flipping the cakes of hell
Niggas been hating on me, my cape has proved to prevail
Emotions show on my face, just know I'm serious
I'm insecure about my body, bitches know I'm furious
Lying to the bone in my teeth
I'm wishing memories that I collected reach the reef
I'm thinking that my soul is cold, I feel the hole in my heart
I'm thinking the ignition is broken, the pedal won't push
Curiosity fills my brain, I'm filled with pain
Reminiscing on memories of my stained bowl
Of course it had spaghetti in that bowl
Man
Curiosity fills my brain, I'm filled with pain
Reminiscing on memories of my stained bowl
Of course it has spaghetti in the bowl
Lying to the bone in my teeth
I'm wishing memories that I collected reach the reef
I'm thinking that my soul is cold, I feel the hole in my heart
I'm thinking the ignition is broken, the pedal won't push
