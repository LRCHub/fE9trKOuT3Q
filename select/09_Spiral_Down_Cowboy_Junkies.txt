Now it all begins
Or continues to
Spiral down
Spiral down

I've laid it out on paper
Instructions of what to do
As my mind begins to waver
Losing contact with you

Now it all begins
Or continues to

Spiral down
Spiral down

Look upon the self
Look upon the other
We need a better understanding
Or we'll spiral down

Spiral down
Continue to spiral down
I'm no where near my peace
As you spiral down
